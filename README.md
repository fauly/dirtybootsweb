# Dirty Boots Café & Roost

Welcome to the Dirty Boots Café and Dirty Boots Roost project! This repository contains the source code for a fluid, intuitive, and emotionally warm website dedicated to our mobile café and open-door bakehouse.

## Project Overview

The Dirty Boots Café is not just a place to grab a coffee; it's a journey, a gathering spot, and a celebration of simple, heartfelt living. Our website aims to reflect this ethos through clean, earthy design, natural storytelling, and a focus on community.

## Features

- **Fluid Design**: The website features a clean but earthy aesthetic with free-flowing layouts that invite exploration.
- **Storytelling**: Each section of the site tells a part of our story, encouraging visitors to scroll and engage with our offerings.
- **Animations**: Light animations enhance the user experience, with gentle fades and slow reveals.
- **Fast Loading**: The site is optimized for speed, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.

## Tech Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: Eleventy (11ty)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom colors for a natural warmth
- **Animations**: Alpine.js (with potential for GSAP in the future)
- **Content Management**: Markdown/JSON for easy updates
- **Hosting**: Netlify or Vercel
